# 2fm-rando-rando

A page just to spit out random settings for the KH2FM randomizer <br>
https://jsmartee.github.io/2fm-rando-rando/

* When using hints, worlds set to Vanilla will show up as "Heartless" even if they have important checks there.
* Enemy/Boss rando does not generate with the link. They will need to be manually toggled.
* Up to 6 worlds can have their setting randomized.
